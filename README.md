# RFID-RC522-ARM-STM32
# üîê STM32 RFID Door Lock System

A secure and real-time door locking system using an **STM32F446RE** microcontroller, **RC522 RFID reader**, **servo motor**, and **I2C LCD display**. Built entirely using **STM32CubeIDE** with **HAL drivers**, this project demonstrates SPI, I2C, and PWM peripheral integration for embedded access control applications.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- Detects authorized RFID cards using the **RC522 module (SPI)**
- Displays status ("Access Granted"/"Access Denied") on an **I2C LCD**
- Opens the door by rotating a **servo motor** on successful authentication
- Uses **HAL drivers** in **STM32CubeIDE** for clean, modular embedded code

## üß† What I Learned

- Initializing and using **SPI, I2C, and PWM** on STM32
- Structuring embedded code with **HAL API**
- Real-world debugging and hardware-software interfacing
- Creating an embedded system from scratch with real-time feedback

## üîÑ System Workflow

1. RFID card is scanned by the RC522 module.
2. STM32 compares card UID to a list of authorized IDs.
3. If UID is authorized:
   - LCD displays "Access Granted"
   - Servo rotates to unlock the door
4. If UID is not authorized:
   - LCD displays "Access Denied"
   - Servo remains locked
